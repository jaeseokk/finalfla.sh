This is a 6-track video & music sequencer accessible to anyone on the Web. Collaboratively created by [HaeKang Lee](https://www.instagram.com/hailhaillab), [JiSu Han](https://www.instagram.com/zeeeexoo), and [ChunChu Kim](https://www.instagram.com/kchunchu_92), this sequencer proposes a new channel of album distribution, allowing users to deconstruct the provided multimedia and to create something of their own. 
 
The idea comes from Andy Warhol’s album cover work for the Velvet Underground’s album released on vinyl, the era’s most contemporary medium. The idea inspired visual artist Lee HaeKang to produce the single album for musical artists Kim ChunChu and Han JiSu for release on the current generation’s medium of the Internet, as an interactive online instrument.
 
You can access the album’s music and video clips via the open-source webpage and produce their own unique sequence and playback to convey a new narrative.
